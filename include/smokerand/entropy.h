 * @details Seeds for ChaCha20 generator are taken from the system CSPRNG
 * such as `/dev/urandom/`. If it is unaccessible - then it will rely only on
 * its built-in entropy sources:
 *
 * - RDRAND instruction (if available)
 * - System time: `time`, `RDTSC`, higher-resolution system clock.
 * - System info: computer ID, process id etc.
 *
 * Even if all hardware sources of entropy except time are excluded --- it will
 * still return high-quality pseudorandom seeds.
 *
 * DON'T USE FOR THIS GENERATOR FOR CRYPTOGRAPHY, E.G. GENERATION OF KEYS FOR
 * ENCRYPTION! IT IS DESIGNED ONLY FOR STATISTCAL TESTS AND PRNG SEEDING!
