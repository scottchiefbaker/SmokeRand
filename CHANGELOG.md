## [0.43] - 2025-12-07

### Added

- Algorithms `threefish1024`, `mwc63x2`, `xtea2`, `xtea2_64`.
- Experimental nonlinear generators `rge256lite`, `rge256ex`, `rge256exctr`,
  `rge512ex`, `rge512exctr`.
- Custom batteries implemented as shared libraries are supported now, see
  the `apps/bat_example.c` and `include/smokerand/plugindefs.h` files.
  It allows to use TestU01 as a plugin (see the
  https://github.com/alvoskov/TestU01-threads repository with such plugin
  containing a multi-threaded version of TestU01)
- New command line key `--testname=name`. Now it is possible to
  write e.g. `--testname=gap16_count0` instead of manual search of numeric
  testid for the `--testid=id` key.

### Changed

- Bug was fixed in the `gap16_count0` test: occasional false failures for
  cryptographic algorithms (wrong computation of `[value .. 0 .. value]`
  gaps percentage was fixed). The bug was likely introduced in v0.41 after
  refactoring after enabling of `-Wconversion` flag.

## [0.42] - 2025-11-16

### Added

- The first public release.
- ChaCha8 added to the `chacha` PRNG. Also AVX2 version of ChaCha now returns
  the same sequence as the portable version.
- `ranrot8tiny`, `ranrot16tiny`, `ranrot32tiny`, `ranrot64tiny` custom PRNGs.

### Changed

- Some code cleanup.

## [0.41] - 2025-11-10

### Added

- The `--seed` command line key was added, it allows to use two kinds of seeds
  for the internal seeder based on Blake2s and ChaCha20. Their usage allows to
  fully reproduce any test battery run for deterministic PRNG.
- Tests dispatcher for multithreaded mode made fully deterministic that made
  fully reproducible runs possible.
- License texts for Blake2s and MIXMAX were added.
- Some scripts for PRNG self-tests and `express` battery runs were added.

### Changed

- Improvements and bugfixes in initialization procedures of several PRNGs.
- Code cleanup and some bugfixes after `-Wconversion` and `-Wpedantic` flags.


## [0.40] - 2025-10-25

### Added

- DJGPP preliminary support; plugins with pseudorandom number generators are
  compiled as DXE3 modules using the `dxe3gen` linker from DJGPP.
- Custom entropy collector based on RDTSC and the system PIC for such platforms
  as Open Watcom DOS32 and DJGPP.

### Changed

- Some bugfixes and code cleanup.


## [0.39] - 2025-10-15

### Added

- `mt19937_64`: a 64-bit version of Mersenne Twister, two modifications.
- Custom `jctr32` and `jctr64` generators based on experimental block ciphers
  by Bob Jenkins. These block ciphers were turned to the construction
  resembling the ChaCha20 stream cipher.

### Changed

- `mt19937`: code cleanup and additon of a test vector.


## [0.38] - 2025-09-28

### Added

- New seeds generator, now it is based on ChaCha20 and uses `/dev/urandom`
  or MS Windows built-in CSPRNG for seeding (if available).
- New generators were added: `blabla` (experimental 64-bit version of `chacha`),
  `lcg42` and some other generators.

### Changed

- Some bugfixes.


## [0.37] - 2025-06-28

### Added

- The `gap_inv8` test was added to the `brief`, `default` and `full` batteries,
  it is required to catch the `swbmwc32` generator and probably other scrambled
  subtract-with-borrow generators. The test is not very sensitive but may also
  detect additive/subtractive lagged Fibonacci generators with small states.
- Some new generators were added: e.g. `combo`, `ncombo`, `mzran13`,
  `mtc8/16/32/64`, `kiss96` (and other KISSes), `swbmwc32`, `swbmwc64`, reduced
  versions of `gjrand` etc.


## [0.36] - 2025-06-15

### Added

- Several new xoroshiro generators: `xoroshiro32pp`, `xoroshiro64pp`,
  `xoroshiro64*`, `xoroshiro64**` etc.
- Updated `biski64` generator, `biski64_alt` modification that passes the
  `hamming_distr` test (pairwise xoring).
- Several new KISS family generators including the custom `kiss64_awc`
  generator that doesn't contain multiplications.
- Several new MWC and SWB generator including the `cswb4288` generator
  by G. Marsaglia; the `cswb4288` PRNG is interesting for `gap16_count0`
  test checking (it fails this test). The `cmwc4827` also fails this test.
- New custom SMWC (scrambled MWC) family: experimental.
- `hamming_distr` test: bugfix, now it checks if PRNG output is wider
  than declared. In earlier versions it causes segfaults.
- `ranval64` chaotic generator by Bob Jenkins also known as RKISS.


## [0.35] - 2025-05-02

### Added

- Several new generators: `biski64`, `melg19937`, `mwc8222`, `xabc`,
  Wichmann-Hill (1982,2006), several inverse congruential generators.


## [0.34] - 2025-05-01

### Added

- Several new generators.
- The new `hamming_distr` test that is based on calculation of n-bit blocks
  Hamming weights and analysis of their distribution. Also processes pairwise
  XORs of that blocks. It was added to the `brief`, `default` and `full`
  batteries.


## [0.33] - 2025-04-10

### Added

- A portable implementation of 128-bit arithmetics subset was added to the
  header files (see `include/smokerand/int128defs.h`). It is designed mainly
  for 128-bit LCGs.
- A new nonlinear generator `wob2m` by Bob Jenkins.
- A portable software implementation of AES was added.

### Changed

- All generators are either portable or at least have portable versions.


## [0.32] - 2025-03-28

### Added

- The variants of the `xxtea` algorithm with 128-bit and 256-bit blocks
  were added (selected by means of the `--param=mode` command line option).
  Options: `scalar-128`, `avx2-128`, `scalar-256`, `avx2-256`.


## [0.31] - 2025-03-26

### Added

- The `mwc32xxa8`, `mwc40xxa8`, `mwc48xxa16`, `mwc128xxa32`, `mwc256xxa16`,
  `threefry_avx`, `xtea` and `xtea_avx` generators were added.

### Changed

- `threefry` and `threefry_avx` generators now support `Threefry` and
  `Threefish` modes as `--param=mode`.
- Improved debug output in the `gap` and `gap16_count0` tests.


## [0.30] - 2025-03-18

### Added

- `apps/test_crand.c`: an example of PRNG testing using static linking with
  SmokeRand core.

### Changed

- `brief` battery extended with the `mod3` test. It is fast but catches some
  nonlinear generators such as `ara32` and `flea32x1`.
- `radixsort64`: switches now to `quicksort64` if there is not enough memory
  for the internal buffers.
- 64-bit birthday paradox uses the custom `quicksort64` instead of `qsort`:
  a slight improvement in performance was achieved.
- Entropy module ror64 bugfix.

### Removed

- `testgens` removed because 32-bit DOS versions of SmokeRand supports DLLs now.
  And for other platforms without shared library support the examples from
  `apps/test_crand.c` and `apps/test_cpp11.cpp` are much more useful.


## [0.29] - 2025-03-16

### Added

- DLL support for 32-bit DOS version was added by means of implementation of
  a simplified PE32 loader.

### Changed

- `express` battery extended: `bspace4_8d` and `bspace8_4d` tests were added.
  It allows to detect flaws in `xorwow` and `mwc1616` generators respectively.
  The `sr_tiny` executable (C89 implementation of `express` battery) was also
  upgraded.
- Improved makefiles for Open Watcom C: freestanding DLLs, 32-bit and 16-bit
  DOS versions.
- Improvements and simplification in a multithreaded battery launcher: dynamic
  assignment of tests to threads, randomization. Estimated times and RAM
  usage intensity were removed from tests info: they were not relevant and
  accurate anyway.
- Some bugfixes in makefiles, especially for zig cc (clang). Now freestanding
  libraries linking is also supported for zig cc / clang.


## [0.28] - 2025-03-10

### Added

- `gap16_count0`: "not enough memory" messages added.
- `Makefile.d32` file for building a simplified version of SmokeRand 
  for 32-bit DOS extenders using Open Watcom C.
- `testgens`: a simplified version of SmokeRand for platforms without DLL
  support. Mainly a hack for DOS version.
- `xoshiro128+` and `xoshiro128++` generators were added.
- Internal self-tests for some LFSR generators were added.

- Improved threads IDs printing.
- `make install`, `make uninstall` and deb package support
  for UNIX-like systems was added.


## [0.25] - 2025-03-04

### Added

- lrnd64 (a modification of lrnd32-1023) generator.
- Open Watcom C support for Windows NT target. It is always a 32-bit build
  and may have performance issues, especially with modern CSPRNGs. But it
  was successfully tested in FreeDOS (HX DOS Extender).
