.SH NAME
smokerand \- a test suite for pseudorandom numbers generators
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B smokerand
\fIbattery\fR \fIgenerator_lib\fR [\fIkeys\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
SmokeRand is a cross-platform set of tests for pseudorandom number generators
(PRNGs). Tested generators should return either 32\-bit or 64\-bit unsigned
uniformly distributed unsigned integers. They can be connected to SmokeRand
either through stdin/stdout or by means of C API as dynamic libraries.
It has the next important features:
.IP \[bu]
Direct support of 64-bit generators without taking upper/lower parts,
interleaving etc.
.IP \[bu]
Analysis of the lowest bits of generators output that improves sensitivity
of tests, e.g. linear complexity, matrix rank or birthday spacings test.
.IP \[bu]
Multithreading support by means of POSIX threads or WinAPI threads.
In this case PRNG must be supplied as a dynamic library.
.IP \[bu]
A minimalistic set of fast, relatively simple and mostly well known
statistical tests that cover the most common artefacts of popular PRNGs.
Users can either apply several predefined batteries or write custom
batteries by means of a human-readable text files.
.PP
The main idea behind SmokeRand is development of statistical tests batteries
that would take into account weak spots of TestU01 (testing of lower bits,
64-bit generators, absence of some newer criteria), PractRand (absence of
birthday spacings and linear complexity tests) and dieharder (relatively low
sensitivity of included tests). The resulting program cannot replace them
but its batteries are diverse enough to be used as a "smoke test" for PRNGs.
However it easily detects statistical flaws in truncated 128-bit LCGs with
power of 2 modulo, additive/subtractive lagged Fibonacci generators with large
lags up to 44497, xoroshiro128+, Mersenne Twister, TinyMT32/64, SplitMix
and even DES in CTR mode.
.PP
\fBWARNING!\fR The SmokeRand test batteries can detect flaws in many popular
pseudorandom number generators but they \fBcannot guarantee a high quality\fR
of generator that passed them, \fBespecially for cryptography\fR. Consider
them just as a "smoke test" for searching obvious defects in pseudorandom number
generators.
.PP
A state-of-art general purpose PRNG must be cryptographically secure, i.e. its
quality should be analysed not only by empirical test but by cryptoanalytic
techniques. Of course, it should be used correctly, i.e. having period at least
2**64, not be prone to the birthday paradox, not be reseeded during the sample
generation if reproducible simulation is desired etc.
.SS Custom batteries
.PP
Custom batteries are kept inside a simple human-readable text files. It supports
single line comments beginning with \# and blank lines. Each non-blank line
contains description of a single test. It has the next format:
.PP
\fItestname\fR \fBtest=\fItestid\fR \fI[arguments]\fI
.PP
\fItestname\fR is a user-defined test name that will be used in a final report.
.PP
\fI[arguments]\fR are space separated list of key-value pairs, each pair
is written as \fIkey\fB=\fIvalue\fR, spaces between the \fB=\fR separator,
key and value are not allowed.
.PP
\fItestid\fR is the test identifier that is used to find the corresponding
engine and send user-defined parameters to id. The next predefined identifiers
(engines) are supported by SmokeRand:
.TP
.B bspace_nd
A classical n-dimensional birthday spacings test suggested by G. Marsaglia.
It has the next parameters: \fBnbits_per_dim\fR (number of bits per dimension),
\fBndims\fR (number of dimensions) \fBnsamples\fR (number of samples/runs),
\fBget_lower\fR (use lower/upper part from each pseudorandom value).
.TP
.B bspace4_8d_decimated 
A modification of 8-dimensional 32-bit birthday spacings test that includes
decimation. It has only one parameter \- \fBstep\fR that should be a power of 2.
This test is especially sensitive to truncated LCGs that use power of 2 modulo.
.TP
.B collisionover
An n-dimensional \"monkey test\". The supported parameters are the same as
for the \fBbspace_nd\fR test.
.TP
.B gap
A classical gap test described in TAOCP volume 2 by D. Knuth. It requires two
parameters: \fBngaps\fR (the number of gaps) and \fBshl\fR (defines the
interval width as \fC[0;2**(\-shl)) * 2**nbits.\fR
.TP
.B gap16_count0
A modification of gap test suggested by G.Jones, the gjrand author, also known
as \fBrda\fR (relative distance analysis).
Requires only one parameter, \fBngaps\fR, the number of gaps.
.TP
.B hamming_ot
Hamming weights "overlapping tuples" based test that detects short and medium
range correlations in bits frequencies.
The required parameters are \fBnbytes\fR, the number of processed bytes,
and \fBmode\fR, the test mode. Supported modes are \fBvalues\fR (compute
Hamming weights for entire values), \fBbytes\fR (compute Hamming weights for
separate bytes), \fBbytes_low8\fR and \fBbytes_low1\fR (compute Hamming weights
for bytes made from lower 8 and 1 bits of values respectively).
.TP
.B hamming_ot_long
Hamming weights "overlapping tuples" based test that detects longer range
correlations in bits frequencies. It considers the input stream as a sequence
of n\-bit words for each of them Hamming weight is calculated. The required
parameters are \fBnvalues\fR, the number of processed values, and \fBwordsize\fR,
the number of bits per word (\fBw128\fR, \fBw256\fR, \fBw512\fR and \fBw1024\fR
values for 128, 256, 512 and 1024\-bit words are supported.
.TP
.B ising2d
The test is based on internal energy and heat capacity computation for
2D 16x16 Ising model by means of Monte-Carlo simulation. Additional lagged
Fibonacci and Subtract-With-Borrow PRNGs with short lags fail it.
It requres three parameters: \fBsample_len\fR (number of values per sample,
i.e. Monte-Carlo simulation run), \fBnsamples\fR (number of samples/runs),
\fBalgorithm\fR (the used algorithm, \fBwolff\fR or \fBmetropolis\fR).
.TP
.B linearcomp
A linear complexity test based the Berlekamp–Massey algorithm, it is
sensitive to LFSR generators such as Mersenne Twister or xorshift.
It takes one bit from the same position from each pseudorandom value.
The supported parameters are \fBnbits\fR (the total number of bits)
and \fBbitpos\fR (position of analyzed bit, 0 is the lowest one;
also \fBlow\fR, \fBmid\fR and \fBhigh\fR can be used instead of
absolute position).
.TP
.B matrixrank
Binary matrix rank test that is sensitive to LFSR generators.
Two parameters are required: \fBn\fR, the square matrix size (must be
divisible by 256), and \fBmax_nbits\fR, the maximal number of lower bits
that are taken from each number (8 or 64 are currently supported).
.TP
.B mod3
This test is a simplified version of \fBmod3\fR tests  from gjrand
and PractRand. Requires the only one parameter, \fBnvalues\fR, the
number of processed values. Catches only some non-linear generators,
but the test is fast and detected flaws may have influence on
computations.
.TP
.B monobit_freq
A classical monobit frequency test that requires the only one
parameter \- \fBnvalues\fR, number of processed values.
.TP
.B nbit_words_freq
A modification of frequency test that considers PRNG output as a
sequence of n-bit words. Blocks of such words are processed by means
of Pearson criterion and then meta-test based on Kolmogorov-Smirnov
criterion is applied. The next parameters are required:
\fBbits_per_word\fR (number of bits per word), \fBaverage_freq\fR (average
word frequency per block), \fBnblocks\fR (number of processed blocks).
.TP
.B sumcollector
The SumCollector test suggested by D.Ugrin-Sparac and implemented in
the TestU01 test suite. Sensitive to the SWB (subtract with borrow) algorithm,
in some cases even to its versions with lower "luxury levels".
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fIbattery\fR is battery name that will be applied to the tested pseudorandom
number generator. Batteries are either predefined sets of statistical tests or
special operation modes. There are general purpose batteries (\fBexpress\fR,
\fBbrief\fR, \fBdefault\fR, \fBfull\fR), specialized batteries (\fBbirthday\fR,
\fBising\fR, \fBfreq\fR), special operation modes (\fBselftest\fR, \fBspeed\fR,
\fBstdout\fR), custom batteries from user-defined scripts (\fB@\fIfilename\fR).
.TP
\fIgenerator_lib\fR is the name of dynamic library (.so or .dll) with an
implementation of pseudorandom number generator or a special mode name.
The special modes are:
.IP \[bu]
\fBstdin32\fR \- obtain an input from a 32\-bit generator from stdin.
.IP \[bu]
\fBstdin64\fR \- obtain an input from a 64\-bit generator from stdin.
.IP \[bu]
\fBlist\fR \- print a list of tests included in the battery.
.SS General purpose batteries
.PP
General purpose batteries are designed for testing general purpose
pseudorandon number generators (PRNGs). The fastest and less sensitive 
\fBexpress\fR battery takes about 1 second, the slowest but most sensitive
\fBfull\fR battery requires up to 90 minutes in one-threaded mode
for fast PRNGs. They don't include some specialized tests that require large
amount of RAM and/or take more than 10 minutes.
.TP
.B express
Express battery that contains 5 tests and consumes 32 or 64 MiB of data for
32-bit or 64-bit PRNG respectively. Consists of 1\-dimensional 32\-bit birthday
spacings tests, byte frequency test, 8\-dimensional 32\-bit birthday spacings
test with decimation and linear complexity test. Detects 64\-bit LCGs with
power of 2 modulo, 32\-bit LCGs, some lagged Fibonacci and subtract-with-borrow
generators, small LFSR. Mersenne Twister and 128\-bit LCG with power of 2 modulo
pass it.
.TP
.B brief
Fast battery that contains 22 tests and consumes 64 or 128 GiB of data for
32\-bit or 64\-bit PRNG respectively. Contains frequency tests, birthday spacings
tests, gap tests, Hamming weights \"overlapping tuples\" based tests, monkey
tests, linear complexity test. Detects Mersenne Twister, 64\-bit LCGs with prime
modulus, 128\-bit LCGs with power of 2 modulo and RANROT32.
.TP
.B default
Slower but more sensitive battery that contains 40 tests and consumes
128 or 256 GiB of data for 32\-bit or 64\-bit PRNG respectively. The test set
is similar to the \fBbrief\fR battery but it is configured for larger samples;
also includes binary matrix rank test and mod3 test. This battery has an
improved sensitivity for truncated 64-bit and 128-bit LCGs, also for some
nonlinear generators.
.TP
.B full
The slowest battery that contains 40 tests and consumes 1 or 256 TiB of data for
32\-bit or 64\-bit PRNG respectively. Includes a special modification of gap test
that allows to detect CSPRNGs with 32\-bit counters (e.g. some implementations of
ChaCha20) and sumcollector test.
.SS Specialized batteries
.PP
Specialized batteries are designed either for search of some subtle flaws in
PRNG output (\fBbirthday\fR, \fBfreq\fR) or for illustrative purposes
(\fBising\fR). Although good general purpose PRNGs should pass them they
are either too slow and/or require too much RAM to be included in general
purpose batteries.
.TP
.B birthday
A 64\-bit birthday test that processes PRNG output as a stream of 64\-bit words.
It counts a number of duplicates in these 64\-bit words. Based on classical
"birthday paradox", consumes up to 2 TiB of data and about 8 GiB of RAM, may
take up to 1 hour even for fast PRNGs. A decimation method suggested
by Melissa O'Neill is used to reduce memory consumption. The \fBbirthday\fR
battery detects statistical flaws (absence of duplicates) for SplitMix and
even arbitrary block ciphers with 64-bit block in the counter mode such as
DES, XXTEA, GOST R 34.12\-2015 \"Magma\".
.TP
.B ising
Statistical tests based on Monte-Carlo simulation for 2D Ising model that uses
Wolff and Metropolis algorithms. Although they are slower and less sensitive
than classical birthday spacings and gap tests, they have an important
historical meaning as an example of 
.TP
.B freq
An adaptive frequency test for 8-bit and 16-bit words that can be applied to the
arbitrary amount of data. Not very sensitive but allows to detect statistical
flaws in RC4 obsolete CSPRNG.
.SS Special operation modes
.PP
Special operation modes are pseudo-batteries that don't make any
statistical testing but are useful for controlling PRNGs integrity,
output redirection, performance evaluation etc.
.TP
.B selftest
Runs an internal self-test for the PRNG if it is available, i.e. implemented
inside the generator module.
.TP
.B speed
Performance evaluation of the PRNG in two modes: calling a function for each
value and summation inside the cycle. A special "dummy" generators are used
as a baseline. The results are converted to the cpb (counts per byte) units
using either \fCRDTSC\fR instruction for x86 processors or \fCclock\fR function
and assumtion about fixed 3 GHz CPU frequency.
.TP
.B stdout
Send the PRNG output to the stdout in the binary format. Endianness is
platform-dependent.
.SS Custom batteries
Custom batteries are defined by users in a human-readable text format.
In this case the name of battery is the name of file with the \fB@\fR prefix.
.TP
.B @\fIfilename\fR Load a custom battery from a file with \fIfilename\fR name.
.SS Optional keys
Optional command line \fIkeys\fR are used for multithreading, applying filters
to the PRNG output, management of the final report layout etc. 
.TP
.B \-\-report\-brief
The final report will include only failed test.
.TP
.B \-\-threads=\fIn\fR
Run battery in multithreaded mode using \fIn\fR threads.
.TP
.B \-\-nthreads
Run battery in multithreaded mode using a default number of threads estimated
from the number of CPU cores, architecture etc.
.TP
.B \-\-filter=\fIname\fR
Apply a pre-defined filter to the generator output. The next filters are
supported:
.IP \[bu]
\fBhigh32\fR Analyse higher 32 bits of a 64\-bit generator.
.IP \[bu]
\fBlow32\fR  Analyse lower 32 bits of a 64\-bit generator.
.IP \[bu]
\fBinterleaved32\fR  Process 64\-bit generator output as interleaving 32\-bit words.
.IP \[bu]
\fBreverse\-bits\fR  Reverse bits in the generator output.
