# Introduction

SmokeRand is a set of tests for pseudorandom number generators. Tested
generators should return either 32-bit or 64-bit unsigned uniformly distributed
unsigned integers. Its set of tests resembles SmallCrush, Crush and BigCrush
from TestU01 but has several important differences:

- Supports 64-bit generators directly, without taking upper/lower parts,
  interleaving etc.
- Direct access to the lowest bits of 32 or 64 bit generator that improves
  sensitivity of tests.
- Minimialistic sets of tests. However, the selected tests are powerful
  enough to detect flaws in a lot of popular PRNGs.
- High speed: `brief` battery runs in less than 1 minute, `default` in less
  than 5 minutes and `full` in less than 1 hour.
- Multithreading support by means of POSIX threads.

Existing solutions:

1. https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3447773
2. PractRand
3. Ent

Requirements:

- C99 compiler.
- 64-bit CPU.
- 4GiB of RAM minimal, 16GiB recommended.
- CMake.

Implemented tests:

1. Monobit frequency test
2. Chi2 frequency test for bytes and 16-bit chunks
3. Birthday spacings test
4. Gap test
5. Matrix rank test: 4096, 8192
6. Linear complexity test
7. CollisionOver test.

Extra tests:

1. 64-bit birthday test (very slow)
2. 2d ising model test (very slow)
3. Long runs of chi2 test / monobit freq test

# Modifications of birthday spacings test

The birthday test generates input values using the next algorithm:

1. Get `ndim` pseudorandom values and take the lower `nbits` bits from
   each value.
2. Concatenate them as `x_n | x_{n-1} | ... | x_{1}`.
