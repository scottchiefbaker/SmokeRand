# Introduction

SmokeRand is a set of tests for pseudorandom number generators. Tested
generators should return either 32-bit or 64-bit unsigned uniformly distributed
unsigned integers. Its set of tests resembles SmallCrush, Crush and BigCrush
from TestU01 but has several important differences:

- Supports 64-bit generators directly, without taking upper/lower parts,
  interleaving etc.
- Direct access to the lowest bits of 32 or 64 bit generator that improves
  sensitivity of tests.
- Minimialistic sets of tests. However, the selected tests are powerful
  enough to detect flaws in a lot of popular PRNGs.
- High speed: `brief` battery runs in less than 1 minute, `default` in less
  than 5 minutes and `full` in less than 1 hour.
- Multithreading support by means of POSIX threads.

Despite relatively small amount of tests SmokeRand can detect flaws in some
PRNG that pass BigCrush or PractRand:

- 64-bit LCG with prime modulus: passes PractRand, some blips on BigCrush.
- 96-bit and 128-bit LCGs by modulo 2^{k} and truncation of lower 64 bits.
  They pass BigCrush but detected by PractRand.
- SWBW: detected by PractRand but not by BigCrush.
- Uniformly distributed 64-bit generators with 64-bit state such as
  SplitMix, PCG64/64, rrmxmx: detected by an extra "birthday paradox" battery.
- RC4 obsolete CSPRNG: detected by PractRand but not by BigCrush. In SmokeRand
  extra "freq" battery is required to detect it.

Existing solutions:

1. TestU01 (https://doi.org/10.1145/3447773). Has a very comprehensive set of
   tests and an excellent documentation. Doesn't support 64-bit generator,
   has issues with analysis of lowest bits.
2. PractRand (https://pracrand.sourceforge.net/). Very limited number of tests
   but they are good ones and detect flaws in a lot of PRNGs. Tests are mostly
   suggested by the PractRand author and is not described in scientific
   publications. Their advantage -- they accumulate information from a sequence
   of 1024-byte blocks and can be applied to arbitrary large samples.
3. Ent (https://www.fourmilab.ch/random/). Only very basic tests, even 64-bit
   LCG will probably pass them.
4. Dieharder (https://webhome.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/General/dieharder.php).
   Resembles DIEHARD, but contains more tests and uses much larger samples.
   Less sensitive than TestU01.
5. gjrand (https://gjrand.sourceforge.net/). Have some unique and sensitive
   tests but documentation is scarce.

Requirements:

- C99 compiler, some PRNGs will require 128-bit integers either through
  `__uint128_t` type (GCC, Clang) or `_umul128`/`_addcarry_u64` intrinsics
  (Microsoft Visual C). C99 was chosen instead of C89 due to mandatory support
  of 64-bit integers and `inline` keyword.
- GNU make or CMake.
- pthreads (POSIX threads) library.
- 64-bit CPU, x86-64 with RDRAND and AVX2 support is recommended.
- 4 GiB of RAM minimal, 16 GiB recommended.

Implemented tests:

1. Monobit frequency test.
2. Frequency test for bytes and 16-bit chunks.
3. Birthday spacings test.
4. Birthday spacings test with decimation.
5. CollisionOver test.
6. Gap test.
7. Matrix rank test.
8. Linear complexity test.
9. Hamming weights based DC6 test from PractRand.


Systematic failure of even one test means that PRNG is not suitable as a general
purpose PRNG. However different tests have different impact on the PRNG quality:

1. Frequency tests failure: the PRNG is either broken or seriously flawed.
2. Hamming weights based DC6 tests: short-term correlations in bits distribution.
   Local deviations from uniform distribution are possible.
3. Gap test failure: the PRNG output has regularities that may disrupt
   Monte-Carlo simulations (similar to Ising 2D model case).
4. Birthday spacings and CollisionOver test failure: the PRNG output shows a
   regular structure (often similar to lattice) that can break generation of
   identifiers and Monte-Carlo simulations.
5. Matrix rank and linear complexity tests failure: there is a linear dependence
   between bits of the PRNG output sequence. Don't work with separate bits of 
   such PRNG, even `a % n` usage may be risky. However, these flaws are usually
   irrelevant for Monte-Carlo simulations and MT19937 and WELL1024a are often
   used as general purpose PRNGs.

Systematic failures in P.1-4 mean that PRNG is seriously flawed and mustn't
be used for computations. P.5 requires a special consideration for each task
and each generator. Of course, statistical tests are not sufficient for
PRNG quality control: state-of-art quality PRNG should satisfy theoretical
"next bit test" and be cryptographically secure.

Extra tests:

1. 64-bit birthday paradox test. Requires 8 GiB of RAM and about 30 minutes.
   Allows to detect perfectly uniform 64-bit generators with 64-bit state
   such as SplitMix, 64-bit LCGs with full 64-bit outputs, some modifications
   of PCG.
2. 2-dimensional Ising model test: modifications with Wolff and Metropolis
   algorithms. Rather slow and not very sensitive, but resemble real
   Monte-Carlo computations.
3. Long runs of frequency test for 1-bit, 8-bit and 16-bit chunks. This is an
   adaptive test that will show intermediate results.

# Batteries

Three batteries are implemented in SmokeRand:

- `brief`
- `default`
- `full`


 Battery | Number of tests | Bytes (32-bit PRNG) | Bytes (64-bit PRNG)
---------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------
 brief   | 19              | 2^35                | 2^36
 default | 34              | 2^37                | 2^38
 full    | 37              | 2^40                | 2^41


# How to test a pseudorandom number generator

Two ways of PRNG testing are implemented in SmokeRand:

1. Through stdin/stdio pipes. Simple but doesn't support multithreading.
2. Load PRNG from a shared library. More complex but allows multithreading.

# Tests description

The tests supplied with SmokeRand are mostly well-known, described in scientific
literature and were already implemented in other test suits. However some its
modifications are specific to SmokeRand and allow to detect such PRNGs as 
64-bit LCG with prime modulus, 96-bit and 128-bit LCGs with \f$ m = 2^k \f$
and truncation of lower 64 bits, "Subtract-with-Borrow + Weyl Sequence" (SWBW)
and incorrectly configured CSPRNGs with 32-bit counters.

## Monobit frequency test

A classic monobit frequency test that counts frequencies of 0 and 1 in the
input stream of bits and calculates p-value. The next random value is calculated:

\f[
X = \sum_{i=1}^n \left( 1 - 2x_i \right) = n - 2\sum_{i-1}^n x_i
\f]

i.e. 0 is replaced to -1, 1 is replaced to 1. The X random value has a normal
distribution (see central limit theorem) with \f$ E(X) = 0\f$, and
\f$ Var(X) = n \f$. Its absolute value obeys a half-normal distribtion
and p-value is calculated as:

\f[
p = 1 - F(|X|) = 2\left(1 - \Phi\left(\frac{|X|}{\sqrt{n}}\right) \right) = 
\erfc \left(\frac{|X|}{\sqrt{2n}}\right)
\f]

Most PRNGs pass it, but it may detect bias in hardware generated bits or some
serious flaws in PRNG implementaton. E.g. multiplicative lagged Fibonacci that
returns all bits won't pass it.

## Blocks frequency test

The test counts frequencies of not overlapping 8-bit and 16-bit blocks of bits.
Chi-squared test is applied to the obtained empirical frequencies to check
if they are uniformly distributed. It may detect some low-grade generators such
as randu, lcg69069, shr3.


## Birthday spacings test

The birthday test generates input values using the next algorithm:

1. Get `ndim` pseudorandom values and take the lower `nbits` bits from
   each value.
2. Concatenate them as `x_n | x_{n-1} | ... | x_{1}`.

 Name        | nbits | ndim | Detected PRNGs
-------------|-------|------|------------------------------------------------------
 bspace64_1d | 64    | 1    | 64-bit LCG with prime modulus
 bspace32_1d | 32    | 1    | Additive LFib PRNGs and LCGs with m = 2^{96}
 bspace32_2d | 32    | 2    | LCGs
 bspace21_3d | 21    | 3    | 64-bit MWC generators.
 bspace16_4d | 16    | 4    | 
 bspace8_8d  | 8     | 8    | LCGs with m = 2^{64}

## Birthday spacings test with decimation

## Collision over test

 Name          | nbits | ndim | Detected PRNGs
---------------|-------|------|--------------------
 collover20_2d | 20    | 2    |
 collover13_3d | 13    | 3    |
 collover8_5d  | 8     | 5    |
 collover5_8d  | 5     | 8    |

## Gap test

A classical gap test described in TAOCP (volume 2). Sensitive to additive and
subtractive lagged Fibonacci and substact-with-borrow generators. Easily 
detects 32-bit PRNGs that exceeded their periods. Even ChaCha12 with 32-bit
counter may fail some modifications of the gap test.

The implementation of gap test in SmokeRand is equipped with "guard function"
that will prevent infinite cycle in the case of constant output from a broken
generator.


## Linear complexity test

This specialized test calculates linear complexity of selected bit of PRNG
output. Uses Berlekamp-Massey algorithm. Very sensitive to the generators
based on LFSR and GFSR such as Mersenne twister and xorshift.

 Name            | Bit for 32/64-bit PRNG
-----------------|------------------------
 linearcomp_high | 31/63
 linearcomp_mid  | 15/31
 linearcomp_low  | 0/0


## Matrix rank test

It is a traditional binary matrix rank test implemented for large square binary
matrices; the matrix size must be a multiple of 256 to make SIMD or `uint64_t`
based vectorization easier. They can be applied either to the whole PRNG
output or to its lower 8 bits.

The test generates 64 matrices and calculates number of matrices with
ranks \f$\le(n - 2)\f$, \f$ (n - 1) \f$ and \f$ n \f$ respectively, then
chi-squared test with 2 degrees of freedom is applied.

The matrix rank is sensitive to LFSR and GFSR generators. However, it is less
sensitive than linear complexity tests and won't detect Mersenne twister due to
its huge state. MT19937 will fail it for \f$32768\times 32768\f$ matrices but
due to \f$ O(n^3)\f$ time complexity such run will take several hours in
one-threaded mode. Linear complexity test is much faster in this case.

 Name                 | n      | nbits
----------------------|--------|--------
 matrixrank_4096      | 4096   | 32/64
 matrixrank_4096_low8 | 4096   | 8
 matrixrank_8192      | 8192   | 32/64
 matrixrank_8192_low8 | 8192   | 8

## Hamming weights based "DC6" test


# Extra tests description

These tests are not included into the `brief`, `default` and `full` batteries
because they are slow, may require a lot of RAM and are usually aimed on some
very specific issues.

## 64-bit birthday paradox test

## Extended block frequency test


RC4: fails at 16-bit chunks at zmax test at 432 GiB of data (PractRand 0.94 fails
at 1 TiB). This test run requred about 25 min.


## 2D Ising model test
