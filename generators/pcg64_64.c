/**
 * @file pcg64_64.c
 * @brief PCG64 PRNG implementation with RXS-M-XS64 function.
 * @details PCG (permuted congruental generators) is a family of pseudorandom
 * number generators invented by M.E. O'Neill. This version has 64-bit state
 * and 64-bit output and its period is \f$2^{64}\f$. It passes almost all
 * batteries from SmokeRand test suite except `birthday` battery that detects
 * absence of repeats in the output.
 *
 * PCG64 with RXS-M-XS64 output function also passes SmallCrush, Crush and
 * BigCrush batteries from TestU01.
 * 
 * @copyright The PCG algorithm family is suggested by M.E. O'Neill
 * (https://pcg-random.org).
 *
 * Implementation for SmokeRand:
