/**
 * @file xkiss8_awc.c
 * @brief XKISS8/AWC is a 8-bit modificaiton of 32-bit KISS algorithm
 * (2007 version) by G. Marsaglia with parameters tuned by A.L. Voskov.
 * Generates bytes, suitable for 8-bit processors without multiplication
 * support and barrel shift (ROR/ROL) support.
 *
 * @details The initial 32-bit version [2] with slightly altered parameters
 * is known as JKISS32 (see the paper by David Jones [4]). The next changes
 * were made to adapt the algorithm to 16-bit CPUs:
 *
 * 1. xorshift32 was replaced to a custom xorshift-style generator [1].
 * 2. AWC (add-with-carry) generator was tuned for 8-bit machines that
 *    support 8-bit addition with carry bit. It is based on the
 *    \f$ m = (2^{8})^3 + (2^{8})^2 - 1 \f$ prime and essentially a LCG
 *    with prime modulus and bad multiplier.
 * 3. Discrete Weyl sequence was made 8-bit.
 * 4. David Jones, UCL Bioinformatics Group. Good Practice in (Pseudo) Random
 *    Number Generation for Bioinformatics Applications
 *    http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Jones/GoodPracticeRNG.pdf
 *
 * NOTE: xorshift from [1] is no longest period possible, bad seed are
 * possible. But it has reasonable statistical quality for its size.
 * We use the seed recommended by the author.
 *
 * Passes `express`, `brief`, `default` and `full` batteries, also passes
 * extended frequency test at least up to 512 GiB (RC4 doesn't).
