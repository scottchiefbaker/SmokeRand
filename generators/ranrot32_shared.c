/**
 * @file ranrot32_shared.c
 * @brief Implementation of RANROT32 generator: a modified lagged Fibonacci
 * pseudorandom number generator.
 * @details The RANROT generators were suggested by Agner Fog. They
 * resemble additive lagged Fibonacci generators but use extra rotations
 * to bypass such tests as birthday spacings, gap test etc. However, the
 * underlying theory is not studied very well and minimal period is unknown!
 *
 * RANROT32 passes `bspace`, `gap` and `gap16` tests but fails `dc6_long` test
 * based on Hamming weights of 256-bit words.
 *
 * The PRNG parameters are taken from PractRand source code.
 *
 * WARNING! MINIMAL PERIOD OF RANROT IS UNKNOWN! It was added mainly for
 * testing the `dc6_long` test and shouldn't be used in practice!
