/**
 * @file efiix64x48_shared.c
 * @brief efiix64x48 pseudorandom number generator suggested by
 * Chris Doty-Humphrey the author of PractRand test suite.
 * @details The author claims that efiix is cryptographically secure but
 * the generator cryptoanalysis was never published (SO IT MUSTN'T BE
 * USED AS A CSPRNG WITHOUT CRYPTOANALYSIS! Empirical tests are not enough!)
 *
 * The minimal period of efiix64x48 is 2^64 because of the counter in its
 * state. It shows a good quality in empirical tests and can be used in
 * numerical simulations. Multithreaded use requires further exploration.
 *
 * @copyright efiix64x48 algorithm was developed by Chris Doty-Humphrey,
 * the author of PractRand test suite. This file is based on its public domain
 * implementation from PractRand 0.94 (https://pracrand.sourceforge.net/).
