 * in Wolff algorithm for 2D Ising model by Monte-Carlo method, see the
 * `ising16_wolff` test in the `ising` battery. It means that SWB generators
 * mustn't be used as a general purpose PRNGs. Their quality may be improved
 * by the decimation/luxury level but it makes them 10 and more times slower
 * than modern CSPRNGs.
