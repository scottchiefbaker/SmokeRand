/**
 * @file ranrot_bi.c
 * @brief RANROT_BI - a simple non-linear generator, it is not connected to
 * the classical RANROT by Agner Fog.
 * @details Fails `default` and `full` batteries:
 *
 * - `default`: Hamming weights based tests `hamming_distr`.
 * - `full` : also `hamming_ot_values`.
 *
 * This PRNG also fails PractRand 0.94 at 16 GiB sample (BCFN test based on
 * Hamming weights).
 *
 * WARNING! The minimal period of RANROT_BI is unknown! This PRNG shouldn't
 * be used in practice! However, it is interesting for checking tests that
 * are aimed to find biases in Hamming weights.
 *
 * The generator is taken from:
