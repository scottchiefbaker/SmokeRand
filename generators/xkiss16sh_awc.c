/**
 * @file xkiss16_awc.c
 * @brief XKISS16/AWC is a 16-bit modificaiton of 32-bit KISS algorithm
 * (2007 version) by G. Marsaglia with parameters tuned by A.L. Voskov.
 * @details The initial 32-bit version [5] with slightly altered parameters
 * is known as JKISS32 (see the paper by David Jones [7]). The next changes
 * were made to adapt the algorithm to 16-bit CPUs:
 *
 * 1. xorshift32 was replaced to xoroshiro32+ (the parameters are taken
 *    from [1,2]). It has too short period for the general purpose PRNG but
 *    is designed for to 16-bit register and is useful for combined PRNGs.
 * 2. AWC (add-with-carry) generator was tuned for 16-bit machines that
 *    support 16-bit addition with carry bit. It is based on the
 *    \f$ m = (2^{16})^2 + (2^{16})^1 - 1 \f$ prime and essentially an LCG
 *    with prime modulus and bad multiplier.
 * 3. Discrete Weyl sequence was made 16-bit.
 *
 * It has a period around \f$ 2^{63} \f$ that is probably too small for serious
 * simulations but is probably good enough for 16-bit PRNG designed for
 * retrocomputing.
