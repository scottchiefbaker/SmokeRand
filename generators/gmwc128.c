 * @brief GMWC128 - Goresky-Klapper generalized multiply-with-carry
 * generator.
 * @details Description by S.Vigna:
 *
 * This is a Goresky-Klapper generalized multiply-with-carry generator
 * (see their paper "Efficient Multiply-with-Carry Random Number
 * Generators with Maximal Period", ACM Trans. Model. Comput. Simul.,
 * 13(4), p. 310-321, 2003) with period approximately 2^127. While in
 * general slower than a scrambled linear generator, it is an excellent
 * generator based on congruential arithmetic.
 *
 * As all MWC generators, it simulates a multiplicative LCG with prime
 * modulus m = 0xff002aae7d81a646007d084a4d80885f and multiplier given by
 * the inverse of 2^64 modulo m. Note that the major difference with
 * standard (C)MWC generators is that the modulus has a more general form.
 * This additional freedom in the choice of the modulus fixes some of the
 * theoretical issues of (C)MWC generators, at the price of one 128-bit
 * multiplication, one 64-bit multiplication, and one 128-bit sum.
 *
 * Comments by A.L. Voskov. The next Python 3.8+ code allows to make
 * a connection between constants in the code:
 *
 *     minus_a0 = 0x7d084a4d80885f
 *     a1 = 0xff002aae7d81a646
 *     a0 = (2**64 - minus_a0)
 *     print("a0 = ", hex(a0))
 *     a0inv = pow(a0, -1, 2**64)
 *     print("a0inv = ", hex(a0inv))
 *     m = a1*2**64 - a0
 *     print("m = ", hex(m))
 *
 * The output is in a perfect agreement with constants suggested by Vigna.
 *
 *     a0 =  0xff82f7b5b27f77a1
 *     a0inv =  0x9b1eea3792a42c61
 *     m = 0xff002aae7d81a645007d084a4d80885f
 *
 * @copyright The implementation is based on public domain code by
 * S.Vigna (vigna@acm.org).
