 * @file cmwc4827.c
 * @brief A complementary multiply-with-carry generator MWC4827 by G.Marsaglia.
 * @details It is a CMWC (complementary-multiply-with-carry) generator with
 * the \f$ p = 4095 b^{4827} + 1 \f$ prime modulus. The a = 4095 value makes
 * possible an efficient implementation of multiplications by means of bit
 * masks and shifts.
 *
 * However due to a specific multiplier this generator fails the `gap16_count0`
 * test in `brief`, `default` and `full` SmokeRand batteries. It passes
 * BigCrush but fails PractRand 0.94
 *
 *
 * Comments of G. Marsaglia about the period of the generator:
 *
 *     After about 5 days, one of them found p=4095*b^4827+1. And it turned out
 *     that the order of b mod p was the maximum possible, k=(p-1)/2^6, (since
 *     we "lose" one 2 because 2 cannot be primitive, and must lose at least
 *     five more because b=2^5 and k is 4095*2^154458). Thus b^k mod p = 1, and
 *     for each prime divisor q of k, q=2,3,5,7,13: b^(k/q) mod p is not 1.
 *
 *     Unlike p=ab^r-1, a prime of the form p=ab^r+1 leads to CMWC
 *     (Complimentary-Multiply-With-Carry) RNGs, in which we again imagine
 *     forming t=a*x+c in 64 bits and again seek c as the top 32 bits, but
 *     rather than x=(t mod b) for MWC, the new x is x=(b-1)-(t mod b),
 *     that is x=~(t mod b), using C's ~ op.
 *
 *     Here is a C version of the resulting CMWC method for p=4095*b^4827+1,
 *     using only 32-bit arithmetic, with verified period 4095*2^154458, faster
 *     and simpler than the previously posted MWC4691() and readily adapted
 *     for either signed or unsigned integers and for Fortran or other
 *     programming languages.
 *
