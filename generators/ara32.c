/**
 * @file ara32.c
 * @brief ara32 (add, bit rotate, add) pseudorandom number generator
 * from PractRand 0.94. It has no lower boundary on its period and
 * fails mod3 test (but passes the vast majority of other statistical
 * tests). Useful for checking mod3 test.
 *
 * WARNING! THE MINIMAL PERIOD OF ARA32 IS UNKNOWN! It was added mainly for
 * testing the `mod3` test and shouldn't be used in practice!
 *
 * @copyright The ara32 algorithm was found in the sources of PractRand 0.94
 * that was developed by Chris Doty-Humphrey.
 *
 * Implementation for SmokeRand:

 * (c) 2024-2025 Alexey L. Voskov, Lomonosov Moscow State University.
