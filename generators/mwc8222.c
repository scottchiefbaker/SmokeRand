/**
 * @file mwc8222.c
 * @brief A multiply-with-carry generator MWC8222 by G.Marsaglia also known
 * as MWC256.
 * @details It is a typical MWC generator with a large 256 lag designed for
 * 32-bit computers like 80386. It seems that there were several versions with
 * several different multipliers, we use one from [1-3].
