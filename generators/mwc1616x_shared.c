/**
 * @file mwc1616x_shared.c
 * @brief A modified version of MWC1616 generator suggested by G.Marsaglia.
 * It has period about 2^{62} and designed for 16-bit CPUs.
 *
 * @details MWC1616X passes BigCrush from TestU01 and all four batteries
 * from SmokeRand. It has much higher quality than the original MWC1616 due
 * to the next modifications:
 *
 * 1. Improved output function: `((x1 ^ c2) << 16) | (x2 ^ c1)` that hides
 *    problems with 3-dimensional birthday spacings tests in MWC generators.
 *    This modification is partially inspired by MWC64X.
 * 2. New multipliers that are much closer to 2^{16} than in the original
 *    MWC1616. Improves equidistribution of bits and allows to pass BCFN
 *    test from PractRand (based on Hamming weights).
