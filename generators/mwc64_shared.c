 * @brief MWC64X - 64-bit PRNG based on MWC method.
 * @details Multiply-with-carry PRNG with a period about 2^63.
 * Passes SmallCrush, Crush and BigCrush tests.
 *
 * @details Multiply-with-carry PRNG with a simple output function x ^ c.
 * Has a period about 2^63. Passes SmallCrush, Crush and BigCrush tests.
 *
 * This PRNG is was proposed by David B. Thomas. MWC itself is invented
 * by G. Marsaglia. The A0 multiplier was changed by A.L. Voskov using
 * spectral test from TAOCP and SmallCrush for the version without XORing.
 *
 * Without XORing this PRNG fails "birthdayspacing t=3 (N12)" test from
 * Crush battery. The similar problem was noticed by S.Vigna in MWC128,
 * and he proposed a similar (but not the same) solution with XORing.
