/**
 * @file pcg64_xsl_rr.c
 * @brief PCG64 PRNG implementation with PCG-XSL-RR output function.
 * @details PCG (permuted congruental generators) is a family of pseudorandom
 * number generators invented by M.E. O'Neill. This version has 128-bit state
 * and 64-bit output and its period is \f$2^{128}\f$. It passes all batteries
 * from SmokeRand test suite.
 *
 * This variant of PCG is commonly used in numerical libraries such as NumPy
 * and SciPy. Its only drawback is dependence on 128-bit integer arithmetics
 * that is outside of C99 standard and relies on non-portable extensions.
 *
 * PCG64 with RCG-XSL-RR output function also passes SmallCrush, Crush and
 * BigCrush batteries from TestU01.
 * 
 * @copyright The PCG algorithm family is suggested by M.E. O'Neill
 * (https://pcg-random.org).
 *
 * Implementation for SmokeRand:
