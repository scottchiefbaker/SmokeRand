/**
 * @file komirand32w.c
 * @brief Komirand32-Weyl is a 32-bit modification of Komirand generator that
 * has an additional linear component - discrete Weyl sequence, this
 * modification provides a period at least 2^32 and average period of 2^64.
 * The modified algorithm was made by A.L. Voskov.
 * 
 * The original Komirand generator was suggested by Aleksey Vaneev. The
 * algorithm description and official test vectors can be found at
 * https://github.com/avaneev/komihash

 * This modification is a "toy generator" made only for demonstration and
 * research. Bad seeds are possible!
 *
 * @copyright The komirand algorithm was developed by Aleksey Vannev.
 *
 * The 32-bit version for testing:
 *
 * (c) 2025 Alexey L. Voskov, Lomonosov Moscow State University.
