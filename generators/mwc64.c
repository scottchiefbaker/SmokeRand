 * @brief MWC64 - 64-bit PRNG based on MWC method.
 * @details Multiply-with-carry PRNG with a period about 2^63.
 *
 * @details Multiply-with-carry PRNG that just returns x.
 * Has a period about 2^63, passes SmallCrush but fails Crush and BigCrush
 * batteries from TestU01.
 *
 * This type of PRNG was proposed by G. Marsaglia. The A0 multiplier was
 * found by A.L. Voskov using spectral test from TAOCP and SmallCrush
 * for the version without XORing.
 *
 * This PRNG fails "birthdayspacing t=3 (N12)" test from Crush battery.
 * The similar problem was noticed by S.Vigna in MWC128 on much larger
 * samples.
