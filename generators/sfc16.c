/**
 * @file sfc16.c
 * @brief SFC16 (Small Fast Chaotic 16-bit) PRNG with period at least 2^{16}.
 * @details This generator is one of the fastest because it doesn't use
 * multiplications. It slightly remembers LFSR based generators but includes
 * a lot of additions. Addition is non-linear operation in GF(2) that prevents
 * problem with MatrixRank and LinearComp tests. The theory behind SFC16
 * is not clear.
 *
 * WARNING! MINIMAL PERIOD IS 2^{16}! IT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR RELIABLE PRACTICAL
 * USAGE! It also fails PractRand 0.94 only at 256 GiB of data, but only if its
 * output is processed as a sequence of 32-bit words (`stdin32`).
 *
 * @copyright SFC16 algorithm is developed by Chris Doty-Humphrey,
 * the author of PractRand (https://sourceforge.net/projects/pracrand/).
 * Some portions of the source code were taken from PractRand that is
 * released as Public Domain.
