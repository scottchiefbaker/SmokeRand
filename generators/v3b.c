 * @brief Velox 3b (v3b) nonlinear PNG by Elias Yarrkov.
 * @details Resembles 128-bit block ARX cipher in the CBC mode, passes `express`,
 * `brief`, `default` and `full` batteries. Mustn't be used in the CTR mode:
 * it won't pass even the `express` battery.
 *
 * Text from the original manual:
 *
 * Guaranteed period for 128-bit blocks is 2^128.[1]
 * Seeds can't begin to overlap before generating at least 2^128 blocks.[2]
 * The expected average period for 128-bit blocks is 2^255.[3]
 *
 * [1] Proof that the minimum period for 128-bit output blocks is 2^128:
 *
 * The structure of this algorithm is
 *   output(x = f(x + (ctr = ctr + 1)));
 *
 * Let's say the output blocks go into an array out[].
 * If there is a cycle, then at points `a` and `b` in time,
 *     out[a] == out[b].
 * Now, the next blocks are as follows:
 *     out[a+1] == f(out[a]+a+1)
 * and
 *     out[b+1] == f(out[b]+b+1).
 * As f is a 128-bit bijective function, we get that a == b (mod 2^128). This can
 * only happen when the difference between a and b is a multiple of 2^128.
 *
 * [2] Proof of non-overlapping of streams by different seeds:
 *
 * Any particular fixed number of state update iterations gives a bijection of the
 * initial block. The seed is placed in the initial block. With two different
 * seeds, two streams can thus never generate the same 128-bit block at the same
 * stream position. If they generate the same 128-bit block at different positions,
 * the next block will necesarily be different unless the counters also equal,
 * which can only happen after generating at least 2^128 blocks, as explained in
 * the previous proof.
 *
 * [3] Explanation of expected period 2^255:
 *
 * The possibility for cycling happens every 2^128 blocks. 2^128 rounds of the
 * block mix is expected to be a pseudorandom permutation. The average period for
 * an n-bit (n not small) pseudorandom permutation is about 2^(n-1).
 *
 * This gives expected total average period 2^128 * 2^(128-1) == 2^255.
